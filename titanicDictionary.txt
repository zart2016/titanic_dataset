Variable Notes

pclass: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)
1st = Upper
2nd = Middle
3rd = Lower

age: Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5

sibsp: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
    Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister
    Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fianc√©s were ignored)

parch: The dataset defines family relations in this way...  
    Parent = mother, father
Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson
Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.
